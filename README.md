**Gold Recovery Prediction Model** is a machine learning solution for Zyfra that predicts gold recovery rates from raw ore during the purification process. The project addresses the challenge of optimizing gold extraction efficiency in mining operations through regression models that anticipate recovery percentages at both rougher and final stages. The system analyzes historical operational parameters and laboratory measurements to build predictive models that can serve as the foundation for an automated control system, eliminating non-profitable parameters and maximizing production yield.

## üöÄ Results
The final Random Forest Regressor model demonstrated:
* 12.82% total sMAPE on test data.
* 13.54% sMAPE for Rougher stage (initial concentration).
* 12.58% sMAPE for Final stage (purification).
* Strong generalization capability with minimal overfitting.
* Consistent performance between validation (12.45%) and test sets (12.82%).

## üíº Business Impact
* **Process Optimization**: Enables real-time adjustment of operational parameters.
* **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces energy consumption and operational costs.
* **Increased Recovery**: Maximizes gold extraction from raw materials.
